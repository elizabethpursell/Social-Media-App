## General questions

1. Did the PM for this week submit this report (If not, why not?)? 
    Yes

2. Has the team been gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?
    Yes

3. Summarize how well the team met the requirements of this sprint.

    This sprint(Sprint 11) was designed for the team to finish the design phases for Phase 3. Backend Developer worked on the ER diagram and systerm diagram, admin developer worked on idea-state-diagram, frontend developer worked on user-state-diagram and web UI, and the mobile worked on Mobile UI. Overall the app design was ideal and the implementation of each component was made well. The requirements for each non-PM member were met, we used our individual time sensibly and we used the group-work time to debug and code review.

4. Report on each member's progress (sprint and phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"

    The status for component of the app was up to date. All components have the essential functionality except mobile. Considering that I was the mobile developer for the last phase, I can say that the mobile was a hard component of the app and it will take a little bit more time to complete. The current mobile developer should be able to complete all the requirements by the due date.

5. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"

    The code review was done together as a team twice a week. We use the the class time to code review in person. Each member showed and discussed the progress. I looked at each other's trello boards and git commit history. I notified my members as we completed each functionality. The reviews were scheduled and completed as required

6. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?

    I encouraged the team to work on phase activities by sending them reminders in Slack and also through texts

7. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?

    I encouraged the team to help each other by asking them to look at each other's codes during code review time.

8. How well is the team communicating?
 
    We are getting to know each other better in small and various ways. Every team member has been communicating frequently and transparently. The communication also improved from the beginning of the semester

9. Discuss expectations the team has set for one another, if any. Please highlight any changes from last week.

    Th team has worked well for the last couples of sprints. We have not seen any unacceptable behaviors, we have been communicating frequently and check-in regularly. During live meetings, we see each other's progress and debug each other's codes. We have not encountered any discomfort

10. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please make sure this is [1] itemized, [2] briefly described, [3] its status reported (resolved or unresolved), and [4] includes critical steps taken to find resolution.

    * Challenge: Some functionality of Mobile Implementation
        * Status: Work in Progress
        * Description: Mobile still need to implement likes/dislikes functionality(Have already made UI, working on JSON Deserialization for upvotes/downvotes), Editing comments functionality, sexual orientation/gender identity for the profile
        * Critical steps taken to find resolution: Group debugging session


## Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

0. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?

    We meet with the mentor on Thursday for about an hour

1. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?

    I have just enough details for the Trello Board. Mainly PM works on the Trello Board, whenever non-pm members wants to add something to the backlog they will let me know

2. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?

    Team meetings were structured so that every member can bring up what they have difficulties with. Outside of the meetings, we still communicate through iMessages and slack,

3. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Trello use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.

    Nothing much has changed from last week, we also created a groupchat using our cellphone numbers so we can reach each other faster if needed.

4. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping thins so constructive?

    No difficulty, I believe everything is so constructive because we have made good foundations for communications since the first week of school

5. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?

    My biggest concern is the level of difficulty in terms of adding pictures to the backend and implement corresponding functionality on mobile, frontend and admin.

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.

    Nothing significant except that sometimes we have obstables implementing some functionality.

7. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * Consider this an opportunity to run a mini [sprint retrospective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))
      > A sprint retrospective is a separate meeting that allows team members to internally analyze strengths and weaknesses of the sprint, future areas of improvement, and continuous process improvement actions
    * An example of something you might "start" doing is including a retrospective at the end of each sprint, or checking in more frequently on slack, or respectfully checking in on expectations of eachother. 
    * An example of something you might "stop" is waiting three or more days to begin the sprint work.
    * An example of something you might "continue" is demonstrating open, honest, transparent communication.

    I would suggest the next PM to start checking the codes for each member every other day and keep up the communication. I would suggest the next PM to stop filming the video on the day that it should be submitted. I would suggest the next PM to continue fostering a positive and constructive working environment.

8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the sprint? How did your time estimates change as the sprint progressed?

    I estimated time pretty well during the early part of the sprint.

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?

    The mobile implementation would cause some concerns for the customers but we are working on getting it fixed as we progress into the next sprint
